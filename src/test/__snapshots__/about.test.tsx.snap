    About me
  </h2>
  <p>
    Hi! I'm a Development Team Lead from York, UK. I currently work at the University of York, leading a team of developers building great products and maintaining the systems that support the outstanding teaching and learning delivered by the University.

  <p>
    I started out in Java and then moved into back-end web development with Groovy/Grails. A while back I transitioned to JavaScript/TypeScript, Node.js and React (mainly Next.js and Gatsby). I've also built up a chunk of experience in AWS Serverless and event-driven architecture.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm really keen on automation and using it to enhance teams' capabilities - I take full advantage of GitHub workflows both at work and in personal projects!
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm also interested in agile team leadership - driving change by focusing on user benefit, breaking things down into deliverable increments and using metrics to inform success. I value an open and collaborative approach to software development, always asking the question "what value are we delivering?"
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm passionate about people - attracting and recruiting the best talent, doing onboarding right, and supporting developers' careers to drive them towards success.

    About this blog
  </h2>
  <p>
    I started this blog back in 2012 to have a bit more of a web presence, and to use it as a place to drop thoughts, code snippets, and anything else I wanted to talk about (hence the tagline "Thoughts, code and everything in-between"). It's fair to say I haven't made the most out of it, but I still like to update it every so often.

    Thanks for taking the time to check it out!
