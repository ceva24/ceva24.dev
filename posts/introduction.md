I decided to invest in some webspace and set up a blog here, mainly focusing on tech/IT stuff. I have a few reasons why.

First and foremost, as a Software Developer, I tend to pick up various code snippets; often mundane yet vital pieces of code that perform the things that you find yourself doing over and over again.

I currently have a Netbeans project that I throw most of these in, or if I come across something that I haven’t need of yet but looks useful, I’ll paste it into OneNote for later refinement.
However, this soon becomes a repository, which requires maintenance. I’d rather be working on a new project than organising bits of code, so I figure I can ease this off by transforming some of the better pieces into blog posts.

I won’t be covering things like writing to file (I can never remember which Stream classes and wrappers to use), but things that are interesting and worth sharing. Hopefully someone will get something out of it. Also, by spending an hour or so writing an article, I figure the topic will become further cemented into my mind, which can only be a good thing.
I’ll probably branch out into more general things too, like specific tasks in Photoshop that I tend to forget, or even just in Windows. Anything goes.

Other things I might post are opinion pieces on a piece of technology, or recent events.

Last but not least, I figure I can use this now and again to air some more general thoughts that are perhaps too long for Twitter.

I make no promises on how often I’ll be updating, but hopefully it’ll be more than just a few times a year. I imagine I’ll go through phases.

Actual content coming soon. Stay tuned.
